# My Game Project

This project is a game built using Angular, NgRx, and Phaser. It started on  today's date.

The project uses Angular as the frontend framework, NgRx for state management, and Phaser for game logic and rendering. The project uses a modular architecture with a store that manages the state of the game, and components that are responsible for displaying the game and handling user input.

The project also uses the NgRx library to handle the state management. NgRx is a powerful library that allows you to easily manage the state of your application, and it also provides a way to handle side effects in a consistent and predictable way.

Phaser is a popular JavaScript game development framework that is used to create 2D and 3D games. Phaser provides a rich set of features, such as physics, animations, and particle effects, that make it easy to create engaging and interactive games.

This project is made with the help of ChatGPT. The goal of this project is to create an interactive game that can be played by users, and it is hoped that the project will serve as an example of how to use Angular, NgRx, and Phaser together to create a complete game.

This project is a work in progress, and will be updated as new features are added and bugs are fixed. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-game-project.git
cd my-game-project
npm install
```

After that, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```


This will start a development server and open the game in your browser. You can then start playing the game and testing out the different features.
